# Project ideas for Fall 2018 Social Media Mining
## IDEA 1: What are the prevalent social issue topic trends and how do they correlate with Supreme Court dockets?  How has the Supreme Court caseload changed over the past several decades? 

## IDEA 2: How active are the owners of different cars, and is there any correlation, positive or negative with the vehicle ownership? How has that changed? Can we predict whether an auto company will increase or lose sales in a given year? 

##IDEA 3: How much influence does social media have on the success of a particular video game?  How much predictive value does SM have on the success or failure of a game? 

###IDEA 1 NOTES
The website http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?var=issueArea#norms provides
datasets however you like. 

Ideas: programatically download twitter datasets, or download and zip/host SCOTUS datasets

Scrub data - most of the Supreme Court data is clean or mostly clean. 
Social media will need to take in the past several years (10?) ID the major social issues from that dataset, express what percentage of politically motivated tweets contain particular hashtags or keywords.  How big is this going to be?

What are my sources of social media? 
	- Twitter
	- Reddit
	- Facebook

What other sources for SCOTUS data can I use? 
	- WashU Law DB (link above)

Comparing sentiment of the Supreme Court vs. Twitter over the past decade? 
What if we compared the sentiment of a particular social topic on Twitter to the number (some quantifiable) of cases on the Supreme Court docket in a given year on that particular topic. Is there a way to quantify polarization - e.g. how strongly people feel and the number of people who feel that way? 

Look at some of the corpus of tweets to see if there's anything interesting going on - 
Find a particular topic on twitter, map it out, and see if there's a corresponding rise in the number/frequency etc... (landmark?) of cases on that topic some months later. Hypothesis is that the 


###IDEA 2 NOTES: 
How do I get the data? 
If I worked for a car company and I wanted to understand how my vehicles were performing by looking at social media data...
1) Download reddit discussions 
2) Would download Twitter, but for practical purposes likely can't due to changes in their policy. 
3) Facebook communities? 

    The names of the 3 individuals in your project group.
    This is meant to be a research proposal. It should not be a list. We except to see section headings, complete paragraphs and correct English grammar.
    The paper should be at least one page long, not including citations
    The proposal should have 6 sections: I. Introduction, II. Literature Review, III. Dataset Description, IV. Research Design and Methods, V. Conclusions, VI. References
    The Introduction should include be 1-2 paragraphs and address the following:

        What your main idea is and why it is interesting?
        Clearly identify your topic; define key terms – cite as necessary
        Motivate the study; tell the reader why it is important practically and theoretically
        Identify a problem, e.g., lack of previous research and explain how your research addresses the problem
        Ask a research question that follows from the above

    The Literature Review should be 2-4 paragraphs long and include:

        Establish the field you are working in - if little research has been done on your topic, find what comes closest
        Cite at least 6 ACADEMIC, PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH PAPERS and at least one paper for each topic area your work falls into, including methodology
            For methodological studies, explain the method that was proposed and how it was tested
            For empirical studies, indicate what kind of data was analyzed, what research question was asked, and what was found
            For conceptual studies, indicate what was claimed, on what basis
        Show that a gap exists for your work
            E.g., This is known about A, and that is known about B, but little is known about the relationship of A to B.  (This is the gap your study will start to fill)
        Clearly cite the related works you discuss using an accepted reference method

    Data Description should be 2-4 paragraphs and include:

        Describe your publicaly available social media data subset.
        Describe how the data is subset and justify your decisions. Your data may be temporally subset, meaning you collect "tweets" from a period of time. Your data may be subset by a certain feature, meaning you only collect data from a certain set of users, hashtags, categories. etc.

    Research Design and Methods should be 2-4 paragraphs and include:

        Describe the main inference or analysis you would like to make with this data. This is the "end goal" of the project. At this stage, you don't have to know how you're going to get there, just what your main goal will be. For Robinson's Trump tweet analysis, the main goal was to identify Tweets written by Trump. For Culotta's flu paper, the main goal was to see if tweets about the flu and flu outbreaks were correlated. What do you want to do with the data?
        Indicate what features you will have to extract from the data and what transformations you will have to do to reach your analytical goal. It's possible, but unlikely, that you can just use the raw data from the social media site as input to your analysis, but you will more likely have to transform the data for it to be usable. Will you use word counts? Do the data come with built-in features (author, time of posting, hashtags) that will be useful? Will you analyze your data as a network?

    Conclusions should be 2-3 paragraphs long and include:

        Reiterate the importance or significance of your proposal and provide a brief summary of the entire study.
        Answer:
            Why should your study be done?
            Why are you using the data and research design you have chosen over other options,
            What are some potential real world, theoretical or methodological implications of your study?
            How does your study fit within the broader scholarship about the research problem?

    References:

        Cite 6 academic sources
        Use APA or another accepted citation style


##Introduction

### Through the Introduction, Literature Review and Conclusion sections, the students 1. describe their main topic and research question (1 point), 2. demonstrate that the proposal and research question fill a “gap” in the literature (that they are original) (1 point), 3. explain the significance of the proposed study (or why it should be done) (1 point).

- Main topic and research question. 
The main topic is the 

 whether we can determine which video games will be successful based on social media analysis


Main topic is social media and the auto industry. The research question is - can we discern whether a subset of social media has any predictive/correlative value on a particular car brand's sales? There have been many analyses thus far that attempt to analyze the sentiment of communities on social media for purposes of 

The study should be conducted to understand the extent of the brand impact that social media can predict.  establishing loyalty metrics, conducting brand audits, discovering defects, and ultimately converting issues into insight.
