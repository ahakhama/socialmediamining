# Project ideas for Fall 2018 Social Media Mining
## IDEA 1: What are the prevalent social issue topic trends and how do they correlate with Supreme Court dockets?  How has the Supreme Court caseload changed over the past several decades? 

## IDEA 2: How active are the owners of different cars, and is there any correlation, positive or negative with the vehicle ownership? How has that changed? Can we predict whether an auto company will increase or lose sales in a given year? 

##IDEA 3: How much influence does social media have on the success of a particular video game?  How much predictive value does SM have on the success or failure of a game? 

###IDEA 1 NOTES
The website http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?var=issueArea#norms provides
datasets however you like. 

Ideas: programatically download twitter datasets, or download and zip/host SCOTUS datasets

Scrub data - most of the Supreme Court data is clean or mostly clean. 
Social media will need to take in the past several years (10?) ID the major social issues from that dataset, express what percentage of politically motivated tweets contain particular hashtags or keywords.  How big is this going to be?

What are my sources of social media? 
	- Twitter
	- Reddit
	- Facebook

What other sources for SCOTUS data can I use? 
	- WashU Law DB (link above)

Comparing sentiment of the Supreme Court vs. Twitter over the past decade? 
What if we compared the sentiment of a particular social topic on Twitter to the number (some quantifiable) of cases on the Supreme Court docket in a given year on that particular topic. Is there a way to quantify polarization - e.g. how strongly people feel and the number of people who feel that way? 

Look at some of the corpus of tweets to see if there's anything interesting going on - 
Find a particular topic on twitter, map it out, and see if there's a corresponding rise in the number/frequency etc... (landmark?) of cases on that topic some months later. Hypothesis is that the 


###IDEA 2 NOTES: 
How do I get the data? 
If I worked for a car company and I wanted to understand how my vehicles were performing by looking at social media data...
1) Download reddit discussions 
2) Would download Twitter, but for practical purposes likely can't due to changes in their policy. 
3) Facebook communities? 

##IDEA 3 NOTES: 	
1) I believe that sentiment analysis and activity levels of a particular video game topic before its release will have some predictive value for the sales of that video game, especially in the short term.
