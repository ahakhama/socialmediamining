    "\n",
    "Getting comments on submissions is a little complicated. With users or entire subreddits, it's simple, because there is a one-to-many correspondence between user/subreddit and the comments it has. However, comments on a submission are organized in a *tree-like structure*; that is, the submission itself may have comments, and those comments may have comments on them, and so on. Because of this, we don't have helpful organizing functions like ``new`` or ``top``. We have to get them all and organize them ourselves. \n",

       "\"Teacher here. Just wanted to chime in and explain why these policies exist, as it was explained to me years ago:\\n\\nThe idea is that if a student can't receive lower than a 50 per marking period, there is never a point where it is impossible for them to pass for the year. Technically, they could not show up for three quarters, pull a 100 in the fourth, and still pass for the year. \\n\\nNow, an optimist would say this is a good thing, as it means the students will always have that opportunity to make a comeback. Particularly in low-income districts that lack parent engagement, the last thing you want is a kid realizing they can't possibly pass for the year and deciding to spend their day on the street instead of wasting it in school. I've seen firsthand students who really only kept coming to class because they still had that chance -- however small -- to pass for the year.\\n\\nThe more pessimistic view is what many have already pointed out in these comments: that it allows schools to keep pushing students through the system without actually teaching them anything, artificially inflating graduation rates and making admin look good. I've also seen this first hand, as well as the fallout when it was discovered by the school board.\\n\\nPersonally speaking, I'm not a fan of giving a student a 50 for doing nothing. I understand there are specific scenarios where a student misses a large amount of work due to crisis or injury, and that should not destroy all of their previous work. However, I think exceptions can be made for those scenarios without being codified as the mandatory grading policy. But, every school I've worked in has had some policy like this, so unfortunately it seems like it's becoming more common.\""
