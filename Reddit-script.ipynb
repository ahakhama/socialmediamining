       "'There are lots of reddit comments in political posts like these with opinions and feelings on the matter. I did some reading up for a bit on what powers the federal court are, how I think they apply, and what implications they have here to help people out. (Shout out to /u/victor_e_bull for some of this info)\\n\\n**What does the ruling say?**\\n\\nFirst and foremost the actual ruling can be read [here](http://documents.latimes.com/read-federal-judges-temporary-restraining-order-against-trumps-travel-ban/). Although the case itself deals with only a list of plaintiffs, the judge has issued an order to the defendants (the US government, Trump, and the agencies involved) that apply to not only these plaintiffs but all immigrants.\\n\\n> It IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\\n\\n>1) Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and all other persons acting in concert or participating with them are, ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from enforcing Defendant Donald J Trump\\'s January 27, 20017 Executive Order by removing, detaining, or blocking the entry of Plaintiffs, **or any other person from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with valid immigrant visas.**\\n\\nSo this order is preventing the government and all involved with them from removing, detaining, or blocking entry to these people. There are two questions now, does this judge have the power to do this? And if so what are the implications of it?\\n\\n**Is this within the judges power?**\\n\\nAccording to the constitution, yes he does have this power. Although he is based in California, he is a federal judge. Meaning his job is to interpret and enforce the constitution. This is indeed backed up by the constitution. A quote from [article 3 section 2](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992): \\n\\n> The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under ... [other cases listed] to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party\\n\\nThe United States is clearly a party in this issue and this judge is part of the definition of the \"judicial Power\" given in article 3 section 1. So he does indeed have the power to make such orders.\\n\\n**What are the implications of this though now?**\\n\\n**1) Is this enforceable?** Sadly not exactly. Although the constitution grants the rights to the courts to review this things and pass these judgements, the only thing that holds the government to following these judgements is good faith. \\n\\nIn the past presidents have indeed ignored this. You can read about it [here](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/9e.asp) in the last paragraph under \"Checks on Judicial Power\" So if Trump chooses to flat out ignore the order there is no official power in place, at least according to the constitution, to stop him from still enforcing it.\\n\\nI feel that this implies that it is important that we as people stand up about this and let our opinions be known. We are the ones that choose in elections what happens. We might not be able to enforce it now, but we can get rid of people who ignore such orders through elections.\\n\\n**2) Can valid visas still be revoked**\\n\\nThe answer I have come to is yes and no. Careful readers may have noticed the order only prevents from removing, detaining, or blocking entry to people with valid visas and nothing else. There is nothing in there that prevents the state department or other entities from revoking valid visas.\\n\\nHowever there are rules and reasons as to why visas can be revoked. [The Code of Federal Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations) is what governs this.[ Part 41.122](https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/22CFR/HTML/22CFR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-500/0-0-0-1928.html) states rules for revocations of visas.\\n\\nPart 1a contains a reference to [a list of reasons](https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-2006.html#0-0-0-1201) why visas can be revoked. Although security and terrorism related reasons are listed (section 3), all cases seemed to requires evidence or \"reasonable ground to believe\" that they are a threat for these reasons. I did not run across any other more general rules that allowed for arbitrary exceptions of that. So in this sense, no they cannot cancel visas.\\n\\nOn the other hand \"reasonable ground to believe\" is not defined in this section of the document so that could be very easily twisted to vague notions of a threat from these countries by the Trump administration. So in that sense, yes they can do so.\\n\\nHowever it is also listed in Part 41.122 4b that: \\n\\n>The alien shall also be given an opportunity to show why the visa should not be revoked and requested to present the travel document in which the visa was originally issued.\\n\\nSo all those effected should in theory have the right to question the decision with our without an attorney.\\n\\n**TL;DR -** *The judges order prevents the government from removing, detaining, or blocking entry to people with valid visas and nothing else. It is within the judges power to do this according to the constitution, however the government can just ignore him. Visas can still be canceled if reasonable grounds to believe there are security risks, but it is vague what that means.*\\n\\n\\n'"
